# Agricultural-Crops-Image-Classification

* This project aims to classify images of 30 different agricultural crops using deep learning techniques. We built and evaluated both a custom CNN and multiple pre-trained transfer learning models including MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2, and EfficientNetB3.
* The goal is to explore model performance across architectures and improve classification accuracy for real-world agricultural applications.
